If an element is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, it will overflow outside of its container.

So, I had my gallery pictures all neatly lined up in the middle, then read the requirement that we are to use a "float" on the images... When I added the float property, as is expected, the parent element collapsed because the images were taller, and the footer smooshed up. I really liked how it looked, so I added a couple more divs to get the same effect. Kind of like using the opposite of clear-fix. I'm not sure if this is proper coding, but I like how it turned out.

Instead of using a caption that was absolutely positioned for the main picture, I absolutely positioned the table the the right of the picture. I really liked how the name and price of the plant hovered over the middle of the plant regardless of the size, but I can easily change that if needed.
