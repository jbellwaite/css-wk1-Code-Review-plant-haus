## Known Bugs
* All bugs are the result of creating my page, then reading the project requirements. I easily could have avoided these problems if I had more carefully read the requirements before setting up the website.

* _I had my gallery pictures all neatly lined up in the middle, then read the requirement that we are to use a "float" on the images... When I added the float property, as is expected, the parent element collapsed. Surprisingly, I really liked how the footer looked smooshed up into the gallery pictures. Obviously, I didn't want the footer included, but I added a few more divs to the gallery section to get a similar effect. Kind of like using the opposite of clear-fix. I'm not sure if this is proper coding, but I like how it turned out._

* _Instead of using a caption that was absolutely positioned for the main picture, I absolutely positioned the table the the right of the picture. I really liked how the name and price of the plant hovered over the middle of the plant regardless of the size, but I can easily change that if needed._

* _When the mouse hovers over the navigation links at the top of the page, a leaf appears. However, on the last two items in the navigation, the leaf appearing causes the whole navigation to slide over to adjust. This happened because I used the "float" property on the elements to get them to move to the right of the page._
